# Introduction 

Paper uses heterogeneous treatment effect and generic machine learning inference. 
Mortality in elderly population 25% are effected.
Conduct first large scale quasi experimental investigation on health care use and medical case. 
Wind direction as an IV identification strategy. 
Mortality displacement as problem with identification.

Use cox-lasso model as further model.

# Literature Review 


# Method used in the Paper 

3 pillars: 

- Mortality and health care use
- Life-Years Lost 
- Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

## Mortality and health care use

* Dependent Variables: health care use, health care spending and net of any confounding factors 
* Include FE: country level, state by month level and month by year level 
* Cluster all standard errors at country level and weight all estimates by population for per captia dependent variables. 
* Robustness to different clustering choices. 
* IV- Strategy: Daily wind direction varying by geography 

## Life-Years Lost 

* Unsupervised learning (cluster analysis) to group pollution effect by county across the US.

## Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

### Criticism: 

- Shortcoming: External validity 
- Model evaluation for ML method not SOTA
- Bayesian Estimation (probabilistic modelling)
- Added value ML here: Prediction of pollution

### Model evaluation for ML 

* c-index 
* brier-score 

## Modification or difference it may have made

### Usage of OLS regression 

* Usage of regularized method for machine learning method but not for main regression 
* PLS for regular regression for transparent feature selection rather than p-value hacking 
* Also possible to model with bayesian approach, allowing for more insightsful information rather than point estimate 

# Conclusion 

Additional Variation via estimation of life expectancy. 
Using heterogeneous treatment effect on quasi-experiment. 
Suggest that life expectancy models vulnerability to air pollution exposure.
