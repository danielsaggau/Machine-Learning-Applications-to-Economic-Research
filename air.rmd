# Introduction 

Paper uses heteorgenous treatment effect and generic machine learning inference. 
Mortality in elderly population 25% are effected.
Conduct first large scale quasi experimental investigation on health care use and medical case. 
Wind direction as an IV identification strategy. 
Mortality displacement as problem with identification.

Use cox-lasso model as further model.

# Conclusion
